### What is Sale Sleuth?
Have you ever have those moments where you see a sale on a particular item marked down 50% from original MSRP, or there is a sale related to a holiday event and you see advertisement saying everything is being liquidated at manufacturer cost? Are these new amazing sale prices really that amazing? What if there was a place you could go to look at the history of pricing during its shelf life? This app will focus on users being able to view the price history of an item and combat against the retail industry marking up items just to slap a discount on it to give the illusion of a sale.

### Project Goal
A user should be able to find an item by its UPC or model number to look up an item and view itâ€™s pricing history across all available major retailers.
